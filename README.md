# 🔍 SF Symbols Lab — Built with Expo

Welcome to SF Symbols Lab — a handy little app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) that lets you **search, preview, and customize** Apple’s SF Symbols.

With this app, you can:

- 🎨 Search through the full library of SF Symbols
- 🧰 Customize symbols with:
  - Weight (e.g. thin, light, bold, black)
  - Variant (e.g. monochrome, hierarchical, palette, multicolor)
  - Animation (pulse, bounce, etc.)
  - Tint color
  - Repeating
- ✨ See real-time previews of your changes

Built using [`@expo/symbols`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/symbols/) — powered by the system-native SF Symbols renderer.
